When the morning comes
Things seem
To stay the same
But if you look real closely
You can see the change
Things fall apart
As we
Come to the end
All our days
Call on me
Call on me
I've been waiting
Call on me
Cause it's you
That I see
When I'm falling
When I'm falling
And it's you
As you leave
As the shadow
Of me
Cause it's you
That I need
When I'm falling
When I'm falling
If tomorrow comes we'll race
Another day
All the time goes slowly
We're already late
We're getting too old
For this chase
Call on me
Call on me
I've been waiting
Call on me
Cause it's you
That I need
When I'm falling
When I'm falling
And it's you
As you leave
As the shadow
Of me
Cause it's you
That I see
When I'm falling
When I'm falling
When I'm falling
When I'm falling
When I'm falling
