It's 1 in the morning (you know what time it is)
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning (you gonna have to come out ya clothes for this one)
It's 1 in the morning (What ever you say)

Yeah I'm still at it
The microphone addict, you get you dome splatted, Cause homie would not have it
Your ashes get scattered, Across the Atlantic
For acting like you a teenage chic with a bra padded
You might laugh at it
Putting you through the knowledge
It is really a tad tragic, How they runnin' through they cabbage
You know my track record, L battle like a savage
I think it grow rich that gives me the advantage
Uncle LL, I got prodigal sales, so I could bail Al Sharpton out of jail
Somebody gotta do it
Somebody in the black community, Gotta get this money while yaw'll march for unity
So march on Ima get my Bentley park on
Then get my dawgs a platform to bark on
The realest brother Unicode hit me and wonder to others
Children shivering under the covers
The man in Black
The tilted Fedora hat
I'm bringing it raw
You never want your money back
I'm focused baby
Livin' like a quarterback
Playin' in the Wish bowl
L keeps opuses black
Systematically, burn you like calories
Watch your mouth, Go earn your little salaries
I'm a classic like Nike airs and Wallabies
You can catch it like a flu, homie follow me

It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning

That's right sleeping Beauty
Wake up see the light
That Tylenol P.M. got u caught for you B.M.
Everybody could see em', the king of ripping coliseums
Come on you is a male groupie begging for bedim
I'm fruitcake laid out in the mausoleum
I'm the richest man in Babylon
Nobody could see him
Money's my slave, it do what I say
It could cry for me, like Denzel in glory
But I broke the cycle, no more poverty
I wonder if you hating on the low, probably
But cats know I'm real
I keep them on they heels
Damn look at my body, could have been a Navy Seal
But you lack the discipline to do what I do
Reinvention, I'm in the 11th Dimension
I'm a value stock pop; get it while it's hot
'Cause once I blow ima split and that's it

It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning

Your Honor last week he punched me in the face
I want 20 million, you know he live in waste
Last week me and the president was taking' flicks
Last week my video dropped, and you were sick
Last week I copped my shorty some kicks
They cost 29 hundred, homie you don't want it
My ears stayed flooded like your man stay blooded
My American Express is Black, no other summit
The Benjamin Graham of Def Jam, yaw'll know
My portfolio was sicker than Polio
Fo' real god is good He took me out the hood
Got me living in a mansion like a big boy should
And I'd never do Cribs
I ain't gon have all yaw'll fruitcakes knowing' how I live (never!)
Bed extra big
You sit around in your mouth potbelly on the couch
Claiming you're hot but honey what you won't vow
Was she alone Puff L I make her bounce
You on the corner risking your life to sell an ounce
Wishing you was Pablo laying in Cabot with a chick named Margo
You flew from Chicago, but no
In real life cats catch you
It's not what you expected
Life's kinda hectic huh

It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning

(Yeah, Yeah it's the definition, the definition)
Go
It's the definition partner 11 in the roll
