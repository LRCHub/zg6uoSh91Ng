Beer turned into bourbon, bourbon into wine
One drink turned into the rest of the night
The way that we were feeling was stronger than a buzz
Don't know what to call it, but whatever it was

I hope you feel it, I hope you feel it
I hope you feel it in the morning
I hope you feel it, I hope you feel it
I hope you feel it in the morning

'Cause I know I couldn't sleep it off even if I tried
I know this feeling's hanging over for a-mornin' to night
I'm gonna feel it, so I hope you feel it
I hope you feel it in the morning

Caught up in each other in the middle of a crowd
You lean a little closer 'cause the music's too loud
You whisper in my ear you got a little crush
I know the liquor's talkin', but when you wake up

I hope you feel it (I hope you feel it)
I hope you feel it (I hope you feel it)
I hope you feel it in the morning
I hope you feel it (I hope you feel it)
I hope you feel it (I hope you feel it)
I hope you feel it in the morning

I know I couldn't sleep it off even if I tried
I know this feeling's hanging over for a-mornin' to night
I'm gonna feel it (Feel it), so I hope you feel it (Feel it)
I hope you feel it in the morning

Girl, I hope tomorrow, when you're rolling out of bed
It hits you harder in the heart than it hits you in the head
I hope you feel it
I hope you feel it in the morning

I know I couldn't sleep it off even if I tried
I know this feeling's hanging over for a-mornin' to night
I'm gonna feel it (Feel it), so I hope you feel it (Feel it)
I hope you feel it in the morning, yeah

(I hope you feel it)
I know I couldn't sleep it off (I hope you feel it)
Even if I tried, baby (I hope you feel it)
No, no
I'm gonna feel it (I hope you feel it)
I hope you feel it (Woah, oh, woah)
I hope you feel it in the morning
